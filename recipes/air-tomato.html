    <p2>Steps</p2>
    <h4>
        Step 1
    </h4>
    <p>Cut tops off tomatoes and scoop out flesh with a melon baller, leaving 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick sides and bottoms. Discard tomato tops and flesh.</p>
    <h4>
        Step 2
    </h4>
    <p>Brush the bottom of an air fryer basket with olive oil.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Combine cooked rice, Parmesan cheese, goat cheese, walnuts, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic in a medium bowl. Combine bread crumbs, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small bowl. Fill tomatoes with rice mixture, then sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Place stuffed tomatoes into the prepared air fryer basket.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Cook in the air fryer at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) until tomatoes are tender, filling is heated through, and topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Garnish with remaining basil.</p>
